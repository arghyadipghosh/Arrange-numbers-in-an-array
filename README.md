You have been given an empty array(ARR) and its size N. The only input taken from the user will be N and you need not worry about the array.
Your task is to populate the array using the integer values in the range 1 to N(both inclusive) in the order - 1,3,.......4,2.
Note:

You need not print the array. You only need to populate it.
